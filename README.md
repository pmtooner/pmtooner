- 👋 Hi, I’m @pmtooner ... I'm a (self-taught !! ) data analyst and mom of a data analyst student!
- 👀 I’m interested in learning more about database development, programming and API's
- 🌱 I’m currently learning BASIC programming skills
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on data analytics tools
- 📫 How to reach me pamela.mattoon@manpowergroup.com
- 😄 Pronouns: nope
- ⚡ Fun fact: I decided to take some of the same classes with my daughter... which is how I ended up here.  I'm filling in the "gaps" on basic and foundational database and programming skills.
